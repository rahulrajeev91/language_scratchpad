Mutable default arguments
-------------------------

__NOTE__: Information taken from [python guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/)

Let's say you want to define a function that accepts a list as a parameter, and you
want the default value of that list to be the empty list, so you write:

```python
def append_to(element, to=[]):
    to.append(element)
    return to
```

If everything was okay, you would expect the following behavior:

```
my_list = append_to(12)
print my_list

my_other_list = append_to(42)
print my_other_list
```

```
[12]
[42]
```

But what you get instead is:

```
[12]
[12, 42]
```

A new list is created once when the function is defined, and the same list is used in each successive call.

Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, instead of each time the function is called (like it is in say Ruby). This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you will and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.

### What you should do
Create a new object each time the function is called, by using a default arg to signal that no argument was provided (`None` is often a good choice):

```python
def append_to(element, to=None):
    if to is None:
        to = []
    to.append(element)
    return to
```
